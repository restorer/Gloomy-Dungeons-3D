And now it’s time for something a bit more funthan just running and opening doors.
And what's more fun than a good kjong-foo sparring match?
Show that you're fully recovered from the last job, and take out that dweeb who’s waiting for you behind the door.

Re-arrange your opponent’s face using only your fists, as befits a true master sergeant of the Imperial Security Committee. Use the action button on the right to punch.
