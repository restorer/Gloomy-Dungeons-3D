That’s all! All our tests are over. You proved that you are in excellent physical and mental shape, and fully prepared to work hard for the glory of the Empire.

But K. department are a bit angry with you and our department, about a certain “compromised” T-999 bot which you smashed the hell out of. They want to put you up against their new prototype.
But they don’t know the kind of combat training you've received. Just break their "T-999-MK2" quickly and without wasting time.

At the end of this test push the switch to return to base.

A T-999 costs six million imperial credits.
A T-999-MKX - fourteen million
Seeing the frustrated officers of K. department when you smash their toys...   priceless
